Testing different prediction modeling

## About my Code
  - I used TfidfVectorizer to fit transform the training data and then transformed the test data.
  - A SVC model was built to predict whether a movie review was positive or negative. I tested how accurate the model accuracy and tried various values for the hyper parameter. 
  - The Naive Bayes prediction model (which is based on applying Bayes' theorem with the assumption of conditional independence between every pair features given with the value of the class variable.
  - Random forest model fits a number of decision tree classifiers on varipus sub-samples of the dataset and uses averages to improve the predictive accuracy and control fitting. I tested this model with the positive and negative reviews and then tested the accuracy on the test data created.
